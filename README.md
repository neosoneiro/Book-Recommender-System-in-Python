# Book-Recommender-System-in-Python

Recommender systems or recommendation systems (sometimes replacing "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) are a subclass of information filtering system that seek to predict the "rating" or "preference" that a user would give to an item.
Recommender systems have become extremely common in recent years, and are utilized in a variety of areas: some popular applications include movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. There are also recommender systems for experts, collaborators, jokes, restaurants, garments, financial services, life insurance and Twitter pages.
The ability of these engines to recommend personalized content, based on past behavior is incredible. It brings customer delight and gives them a reason to keep returning to the website. Due to this very reason, recommender systems have become a crucial part of the back end functioning of user-oriented social websites like Facebook, Netflix, Amazon etc.
In this project, we have to simulate a recommender system of an ecommerce site (like Amazon) to recommend books to a customer based on his past reading preferences.
